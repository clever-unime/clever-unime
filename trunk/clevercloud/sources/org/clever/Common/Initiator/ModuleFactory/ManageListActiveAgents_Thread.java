 * The instance of this class will run in a separate thread.
 * Its purpose is to synchronize the list of active processes with the list of process names, 
 * callable in cleverAdministration using the command "listactiveagents".
 * Every time a new agent is launched, its name is added to the list of names and 
 * a thread of this type is launched. 
 * When the agent process will end, this thread will wake up and delete its name from the list.
